# Sentiment-Analysis-Python

*Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews using Python, Machine Learning, and NLTK*

*Overview*

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews to determine whether they are positive or negative. It utilizes Python, machine learning algorithms, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to classify reviews and gain insights into customer opinions.

*Features*

- Sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using machine learning
- Classification of reviews as Positive or Negative
- Insights into customer opinions and preferences
- Identification of areas for product improvement and customer satisfaction

*Technologies Used*

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

*Dataset*

- Amazon reviews dataset (available in the `data` folder)
- Reviews are preprocessed and split into training and testing sets
